## Teams

Our roles at thomann.io are clustered in different units. Each unit provides different roles. They all assembly in product teams, service teams, or communities. Each team has free choice about their means of work and process frameworks, as long as they contribute value for our customers in regular, short iterations.

### Product teams

- B2C as customers
- data-driven work
- finding metrics
- focusing on goals

Product teams combine roles from engineering, product, uiux, and agile to own parts of our webshop and app. They use service teams to succeed in their projects.

#### [Team bk-nusprig](https://thomann.io/blog/a-day-at-the-bk-nusprig-drive-in)

Topic: state-of-the-art customer experience

#### Team scharf team

Topic: access to assortment and services

#### Team APPic

Topic: Thomann mobile app

#### Team s.toolgang

Topic: tools that improve our business processes

### Service teams

- engineers and other internal roles as customers
- improve development experience
- support product teams in cross-functionality

Service teams usually have their competency in one unit. Examples are our platform team, operations, data or people & culture. They support our product teams in working end-to-end. 

**Important note:** When service teams grow, we'll add their roles to product teams where it makes sense. This enables more autonomous work within the product teams. 

#### Team Ops

Topic: infrastructure for the Thomann universe

#### Team Data

Topic: everything related to BI and our data warehouse

#### Team Flavortown

Topic: state-of-the-art development experience for thomann.de

#### Team People & Culture

Topic: provide p&c services to teams, communities, and units

### Switching teams

Should a team member not feel comfortable (like really uncomfortable) with their team, there's an option to switch teams. The highest priority here is to look for direct communication. There are some requirements for finding/forming a new team:

1. Functioning teams must endure
2. Teams must be able to develop features for their focus topic
3. Teams shall span multiple locations
4. A new team constellation shall improve our product development

## Communities

Communities are team members that work on a shared mission. Every team member can join or create a community. They can exist for a long time (e.g. uiux, branding, or poac) or just for a few days or weeks (e.g. to organize a team event). 

### Strategy Community

This community syncs all lead people with our CDO. It reports on ongoing yearly objectives and makes strategic decisions for thomann.io aligned with objectives from Thomann GmbH. The community meets weekly.

### UIUX Community

This community creates a general look & feel for our customer-facing channels. While ui designers are part of our product teams, it's important that they have a place to sync and work on a shared design system. 

### POAC (product owners & agile coaches)

This community brings together our product owners and agile coaches. It's a safe space to exchange about team topics and learn from another. This community follows the Vegas rule and currently does not allow lead persons. The community meets biweekly.

### Branding

This community takes care of our employer branding. Cyberpunk style and stickers? All by them. The community meets biweekly.

### CoP Agile

This community talks about agile and the world around it. Even if you're not working with us, you can join and participate. The community meets every 3-4 weeks and usually invites external guests. If you're interested, just email to ralph.cibis@thomann.de.

### BizAdmin

This community takes care of becoming thomann.io.

### Lead community

This community syncs all lead people twice a week.

### People Meta Topics

This community takes care of creating onboarding guidelines, appraisal interview templates, training options for team members, and the handbook.

### Always room for more ideas

Make up your own community! If you have an idea, found a community:

- create a public slack channel (private only, if it's really REALLY necessary)
- send an @channel message in #announcements to inform everyone about your community and its mission
- add the community to this section of the employee handbook
- get started on your mission

**Important note:** make sure that participating in a community doesn't block you in your current role (e.g. engineer in a product team). Be transparent about it and check with your team, if you think the team's performance might decrease.

## Zooming out

thomann.io itself integrates into Thomann Universe just as any other department would. thomann.io functions as Thomann’s tech and data department.

Besides us, there are many other departments, e.g. marketing, logistics, purchase management, sales, customer care, hr, audio professional, etc.
